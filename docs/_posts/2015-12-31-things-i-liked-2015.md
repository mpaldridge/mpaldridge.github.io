[**A Selection of Jokes About the Pope's Momma**](http://gawker.com/a-selection-of-jokes-about-the-popes-momma-1679712485)

**[What it's like to lose $225,000 on _Who Wants to be a Millionaire_](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2015/02/who_wants_to_be_a_millionaire_i_lost_on_the_show_and_it_almost_destroyed.html)**

FILMS: It's not original to say that [**Carol**](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2015/11/cate_blanchett_and_rooney_mara_in_todd_haynes_carol_reviewed.html) was great, but three underrated parts: Sarah Paulson, [the music](https://open.spotify.com/album/3gx0VobVNh66EVxGnM0yXU), the ending. \| [**Ex Machina**](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ex-machina-2015), because I'm a sucker for sci-fi chamber pieces like this, and because the [dancing scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGY44DIQb-A) was the greatest single scene this year by a mile. \| Honorable mentions: **The Look of Silence**, **Birdman**, **The Lobster**, **Phoenix**, the final wedding segment of **Wild Tales**.

**[The earthquake piece](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one) you've probably already read**

[**Strunk and White: Grammar Police**](http://www.themillions.com/2015/09/scenes-from-our-unproduced-screenplay-strunk-white-grammar-police.html)

TV: I thought [**The Jinx**](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/23/what-about-bob) would be the runaway winner of the best true crime documentary short series award, but then [**Making a Murderer**](http://www.vulture.com/2015/12/making-a-murderer-as-good-as-serial-if-not-better.html) came along at the end to make it a tie. \| Farewell to **Mad Men**, probably my favourite (long/American) TV series from beginning to end. Some favourite moments: [what you call love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjg5TuXV09U),  [carousel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus), [litter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhcKuMjvcCk), [lawn mower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI2A8bQv2xA), [dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuzvp8hiY30), [roller skating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXuKqqv6Mok), ...

**Two pieces by Dana Stevens**, _Slate_ film critic (and culturegabfester) : [on watching films with her daughter](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2015/01/watching_movies_with_children_how_my_daughter_s_screen_habits_changed_my.html); [on visiting Japan and finding films there](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2015/10/japanese_film_tour_ghibli_museum_the_lost_in_translation_pool_and_toho_studios.html)

MUSIC: Best album: Björk's **Vulnicura**, especially the magnificent first half. [Review by Carl Wilson](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2015/01/bjork_s_new_album_vulnicura_reviewed.html) ("The fact that time does heal is merciful but also reducing. It renders our past losses unjustly banal."); [interview with Jessica Hopper](http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/9582-the-invisible-woman-a-conversation-with-bjork/). (Runners-up: **Natalie Prass**, **Tame Impala**, **Sufjan Stevens**, **Grimes**) \| Best singles: [**"The Blacker the Berry"**](https://open.spotify.com/album/05OUNCvQTUIoxP2USQuWWp) by Kendrick Lamar, [**"Dreams"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTM3YPTYNo0) by Beck, [**"REALiTi"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9XKLqGqwLA) (demo over album), [**"Seesaw"**](https://open.spotify.com/track/1nXRacxi1isUvleBB6Jgx7). \| Best EP: **FKA twigs** _[above]_ (runner-up: [**Nao**](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20620-february-15-ep/)) \| Best video: **FKA twigs** _[above]_ (runner-up: [**Nao**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7vHqhRXZpY)) \| Best rejected Bond song: [**"Spectre"**](https://soundcloud.com/radiohead/spectre) \| Best Bach prelude played on boomwhackers: [**No. 1 in C major**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5seI0eJZCg) \| Best cast recording of a Broadway musical based on the life of a US treasury secretary: [**Hamilton**](https://open.spotify.com/album/1kCHru7uhxBUdzkm4gzRQc) \| [A playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/mpaldridge/playlist/7DDIYRIj1e3uizPq2SMuYa)

[**Janet Malcolm on Joseph Mitchell**](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/04/23/joseph-mitchell-master-writer-city/) – I disagree with almost all of this, and it's still great. (For a start, _Joe Gould's Secret_ is better than _The Bottom of the Harbor_.)

[**How different popsingers sang the national anthem at the Superbowl**](http://popbitch.com/home/2015/01/29/oh-say-can-you-sing/)

PODCASTS: **Love & Radio**: [The Living Room](http://loveandradio.org/2015/03/the-living-room/) \| **Mystery Show**: [Britney](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/case-2-britney/) \| **This American Life**: [on a winner of the green card lottery](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/560/abdi-and-the-golden-ticket) and [on school desegregation](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) \| [**No Such Thing As a Fish**](http://qi.com/podcast) \| [**Slate's Culture Gabfest**](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/culturegabfest.html), especially [Dana's nutmeg endorsement (from 48:01)](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/culturegabfest/2015/12/slate_s_culture_gabfest_on_creed_marvel_s_jessica_jones_and_regulating_addiction.html)

[**"Blood Ties"**](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/09/blood-ties) is just a very well done crime piece

**Trump lolz**: [[1]](https://vine.co/v/edXbvrwdpgE) [[2]](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/donald-trump-through-the-ages) [[3]](https://twitter.com/grahamdavida/status/651883528637050880)

[**Remarks by the President in Eulogy for the Honorable Reverend Clementa Pinckney**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRvBzzR5tdA) (Go from [18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRvBzzR5tdA?t=18m8s) – "This whole week, I’ve been reflecting on this idea of grace" – if you must, but don't just skip to the end)

OLD THINGS I CAME ACROSS THIS YEAR: [**"Doubt"**](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1994/01/31/doubt-3) by William Finnegan, which seems sort of Serial precursory \| [**"Eyes of a Blue Dog"**](https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~cinichol/CreativeWriting/323/GarciaMarquezEyesDog.htm), a short story by Gabriel García Márquez \| **[Pastel Blues](https://open.spotify.com/album/5b2uj8OsgNJAbJuKyNykRb)** by Nina Simone, although _Little Girl Blue_ will always be my first love \| Sheila Heti's [**How Should a Person Be?**](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/books/review/how-should-a-person-be-by-sheila-heti.html) \| **The films of Howard Hawks**: _His Girl Friday_ and _Bringing Up Baby_ are perfect romantic comedies; _To Have and Have Not_ has relegated _Casablanca_ to my second-favourite Humphrey Bogart film set mostly in a bar in a Vichy-controlled French overseas territory during the second world war; _Only Angels Have Wings_ is good but perhaps a smidgen overrated; _The Big Sleep_ is beautiful, moody, and thoroughly incomprehensible; _Ball of Fire_ is fun and Barbara Stanwyck terrific in it.

[**"Above all, I have been a sentient being, a thinking animal, on this beautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure."**](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/opinion/oliver-sacks-on-learning-he-has-terminal-cancer.html)

[**"Each Day Unexpected Salvation (John Cage)"**](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/each-day-unexpected-salvation-john-cage), a poem by Anne Carson \| [**"This Poem Will Blow Your Tits Clean Off"**](https://133millionand1.tumblr.com/post/132077058349/a-sonnet), a sonnet by @\_L\_M\_C\_
