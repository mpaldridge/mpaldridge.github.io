Last year, *The New Yorker* published ["The Plague Year"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/04/the-plague-year), a very long piece by Lawrence Wright about the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic. Which made me wonder: Is this the longest *New Yorker* article since I started reading the magazine in 2009? When did the magazine last run an article this long? What are some other long articles from the magazine? The answers are: Yes, 2004, and the following list.

*Programming notes: Articles have got shorter over time, so the word count needed to get on this list increases as we get further into the past. Word counts for properly digitised articles are given to the nearest thousand words; word counts for other articles are roughly estimated from the page count in the magazine – I hope these might often be accurate to within 10%. I've tried not to miss any post-1970 articles, but I've surely failed; no attempt at completeness before 1970 has been made. Sometimes the distinction between "an article" and "a series of articles" is unclear, so I made a knee-jerk decision.*

## Pre-1970

*Before 1970,* The New Yorker *didn't have a a proper Table of Contents, which means finding long articles quickly is prohibitively difficult. I did happen to come across the following long articles, but I make absolutely no claims of completeness for this list.*

* ["The Luzhin Defense](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1964/05/09/the-luzhin-defense-part-i) by Vladimir Nabokov (1965, two parts, 55k words, book of the same title);
* ["The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1961/10/14/the-prime-of-miss-jean-brodie) by Muriel Spark (1961, 31k words, book of the same title);
* ["The Ponder Heart"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1953/12/05/the-ponder-heart) by Eudora Welty (1953, 27k words, book of the same title).

The longest **poem** I found was John Betjeman's autobiographical poem ["Summoned by Bells"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1960/08/27/summoned-by-bells) (1960, 1250 lines, book of the same title). This technically ran as a "Profile", in which case the next-longest poem I know of (without looking very hard) is ["Falling"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1967/02/11/falling-2) by James Dickey (1967, 180 lines, books: "Falling, May Day Sermon, and other poems" and "The Whole Motion").
