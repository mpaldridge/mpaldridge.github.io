The past couple of weeks I've been at the [Leeds International Film Festival](https://www.leedsfilm.com) for the second time – see [this blogpost](liff-2018.html) for my thoughts from LIFF 2018. This time, I've tried to correct my only minor error from last year: I've bought more tickets to more films! And, this time, I've included plenty of the old films too, not just the new ones – this turned out to be an extremely good plan.

However, one of my strongest memories of LIFF 2019 is not going to be any of the films but rather my back. Somehow, around lunchtime of the first day of the festival, I ... I don't know, did something weird to my back? Weird, and extremely stiff, and very painful. And the absolute worst thing for it was to sit down for a long period of time – which is kind of the only thing one does at a film festival. I managed to make it to the opening film, *Rocks*, albeit without either being to either put on socks or do up my shoelaces, before giving up on the second film of the night (*I Lost My Body*, which I did catch up on later in the festival). I bravely managed to keep up most of my planned schedule, but I cried off a few of the very long films – *A Hidden Life* (176 minutes), *The Irishman* (210 minutes), *Heimat Is a Space in Times* (218 minutes) – worried that I might end up stuck in my seat forever.

Like last time, the stars are whatever I tore in the Audience Award voting sheets (and, like last time, ★★★**+** means "I gave this ★★★, but only because I am a stingy marker, and it probably deserves ★★★★ really.")

## The films

**Rocks** (Sarah Gavron) 🇬🇧 [Opening film]  
Teenage girls from East London are the real heroes we need. The little brother with the frog is an early favourite for this year's The Kid From *Capernaum* Award for cutest youngster. ★★★**+**

**Atlantics** / *Atlanqiue* (Mati Diop) 🇸🇳🇫🇷  
It takes a little while to get going (or maybe for me to get into it), but once it does it's very good – deep and spooky. Excellent score by Fatima Al Qadiri. ★★★★

**Beanpole** / Дылда (Kantemir Balagov) 🇷🇺  
Relentlessly grim film set in postwar Leningrad. I think this might be very good if you have the mood and the patience for it, but I did not. ★★

**Calm With Horses** (Nick Rowland) 🇮🇪  
100 minutes of consistent low-level dread, which is the kind of film I like! Good score by Blanck Mass. ★★★★

**The Candidate** / The Realm / *El reino* (Rodrigo Sorogoyen) 🇪🇸  
Spanish political corruption drama. Doesn't really work, although the ending is good. ★★

**Days of the Bagnold Summer** (Simon Bird) 🇬🇧  
Likeable and pleasantly low-key drama, with lots of affection for its characters. I even liked the dog. ★★★**+**

**Genesis** / *Genèse* (Philippe Lesage) 🇨🇦  
I'm probably being unfair on this, which was mostly perfectly fine, but at the advertised end time it kicked into a brand new and boring storyline unrelated to anything else that went on before, stayed with it for far too long, and squandered any goodwill it had built up. More walkouts than any other film this LIFF – although that may have been due to said inaccurate length and people needing to get elsewhere. ★★

**House of Hummingbird** / 벌새 (Kim Bora) 🇰🇷  
I sort of liked this, but it was pretty long and slow, and reports suggest I wasn't the only one fighting to stay awake. Would probably work better for a South Korean audience for whom the Seongsu bridge disaster was an important historical/cultural event. ★★

**The Invisible Life of Eurídice Gusmão** / Invisible Life / *A Vida Invisível de Eurídice Gusmão* (Karim Aïnouz) 🇧🇷  
Chronicle of two sisters who spend most of their twenties separated from each other. Ferrante-esque, I thought; melodrama in the best sense of the word. 2 hours 20; I wished it were longer. ★★★★

**The Irishman** (Martin Scorsese) 🇺🇸  
Caught up with this at the cinema but outside the festival. Consistently interesting, with excellent performances from De Niro, Pesci and, perhaps most of all, Pacino. It is undeniably long, though: a number of people here checked their phones during the film (I'm sure the LIFF attendees wouldn't have done this), but if I were watching at home on Netflix when it comes out in a few weeks' time I might well have done the same.  ★★★**+**

I missed, but hope to catch up later with *The Image Book* and *Ray and Liz*. [*Later update: I watched the first half of* The Image Book *on my laptop and found it unwatchable...*]

## Short films

The short film programme is quite a big part of the festival – filmmakers can submit their short films, and it's somewhat prestigious to be chosen to be shown at the festival, and more prestigious to win one of the many awards (internationa, British, Yorkshire, animation, queer, dance, etc). But, unless you're super-interested in this and want to see a whole bunch of shorts, it's difficult to know what to go to -- there are a bunch of 90-minute-ish sessions called, like, "International 6", "Animation 3", "British 2", or whatever. But they do have a special session late on in the festival where they show the award-winners, so I went to that.

My favourite was the surreal stop-motion animation [**Raymonde, or the Vertical Escape**](https://vimeo.com/300223370) / *Raymonde, ou l'évasion verticale* (Sarah Van Den Boom) 🇫🇷✏️. I also liked [**Afterword**](https://vimeo.com/300223370) (Boris Seewald) 🇩🇪💃.

## Retrospective: Time Frames

The film festival also has a "retrospectives" strand, showing old films. This year, these were on the theme of films that take place within 24 hours. (A few of the new films –  *Guilty*; *Happy New Year, Colin Burstead*; *Utøya* – were crowbarred into this strand too.) In hindsight, I regret my foolishness in not seeing more of these; it's sometimes a bit awkward to fit them in (they often didn't have the prime evening timeslots), but seeing old films on the big screen is always better than you think it's going to be. So I could have seen, for example, *12 Angry Men*, *Before Sunrise*, *Cléo from 5 to 7*, *Dog Day Afternoon*, *Knife in the Water*, *Magnolia*, *Reservoir Dogs*, *Run Lola Run* (all of which I've seen on the small screen before) and *Blackmail*, *Dazed and Confused*, *The Docks of New York*, La Haine, La Notte, *Wild Strawberries* (which I haven't).

**Daughters of the Dust** (Julie Dash, 1991) 🇺🇸  
An astonishing visual feast -- there's no other film that looks like this. ★★★★★

**Do the Right Thing** (Spike Lee, 1989) 🇺🇸  
On of the all-time greatest films -- and played really loudly in a busy cinema, it's even better. ★★★★★
