**[A profile of Apollo Robbins](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/07/a-pickpockets-tale)**, possibly the greatest pickpocket in the world. (The opening feels like a nod to Mark Singer's opening to his [famous profile of Ricky Jay](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/04/05/secrets-of-the-magus). Also, don't miss [the accompanying video](https://www.newyorker.com/video/watch/apollo-robbins-tricks-of-the-trade).)

PODCASTS: **This American Life** [at Harper High School (part 1](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/487/harper-high-school-part-one), [part 2](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/488/harper-high-school-part-two)) and [at a car showroom](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/513/129-cars) \| The [**Slate Culture Gabfest**](https://slate.com/podcasts/culture-gabfest) is always good, but [the discussion of Dana's anti-flipflops piece (from 34:45)](https://www.wnyc.org/story/18c5a9595131ff03ec8001bc/) may be the Gabfestiest moment since the infamous granola-off \| [Natasha Vargas-Cooper on the **Longform podcast**](https://longform.org/player/longform-podcast-39-natasha-vargas-cooper) \| [**Radiolab**: Speed](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/episodes/267124-speed) \| [Stephen Fry on **RHLSTP**](https://play.acast.com/s/rhlstp/rhlstp-18-stephen-fry) (RHLSTP!)

**[In defence of Gus van Sant's *Psycho* remake](https://www.houstonpress.com/film/gus-van-sants-psycho-just-turned-15-and-is-more-fascinating-than-you-remember-6600081)**

MUSIC: Best albums: **Yeezus** was impressive for how much effort it went to to actively piss off its audience, and was also great. ([Here](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2013/06/kanye_west_s_yeezus_reviewed.html)'s Carl Wilson; [here](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/24/black-noise)'s SFJ.) My favourite album of the year, though, was the underrated **Amok** by Atoms for Peace -- I think has been underrated because people heard "Thom Yorke and Flea" and were hoping for funk Radiohead, so were disappointed to get slightly Afrobeaty Radiohead but with interesting real/electronic percussion interplay \| Best singles: **Arctic Monkeys** (*above*; the album is good too), [**Sleigh Bells**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UULVVnRcYOk), [**Bonobo feat Erykah Badu**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq7p_PuxRDI) \| Best EP: [**FKA twigs**](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18590-twigs-ep2/) \| Best live version of a song already mentioned on this list: [**Amok** by Atoms for Peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP3iKrMDE-g) (I'm not sure if I'm in the audience of that video, or whether it's from the other night) \| Best remix of a David Bowie song inspired by Steve Reich's "Clapping Music": ["Love Is Lost" remixed by James Murphy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOy7vPwEtCw) \| Best unreleased cover of Jennifer Paige's Crush: [Jai Paul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvHYFl0kqIk) \| [a playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7hrqmvmXv64RseQR99pNu4?si=409e8d7ca15149a4)

**[Don’t make fun of renowned author Dan Brown](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/dont-make-fun-of-renowned-dan-brown/)**

**[On Smarm](https://www.gawkerarchives.com/on-smarm-1476594977)** -- I think about this essay at least once a week, plus it has little Thumper bunny pictures in it.

FILMS: [**The Act of Killing**](https://slate.com/culture/2013/07/the-act-of-killing-documentary-reviewed.html) is extraordinary -- the penultimate scene where Anwar Congo returns to the rooftop will stay with me for a long time. I am not embarassed to say I loved **Gravity**. **Before Midnight** completes the best film trilogy ever made. **Enough Said** makes me sad James Gandolfini didn't get to make more romantic comedies.

[**Thanksgiving in Mongolia**](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/18/thanksgiving-in-mongolia) by Ariel Levy. This is beautiful and heartbreaking and I hope it's not insensitive to say it's also sometimes like a horror film. (Also: [Levy profiles Edith Windsor](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/the-perfect-wife).)

OLD THINGS I CAME ACROSS THIS YEAR: Nina Simone's 1958 debut album **Little Girl Blue** is her most straightforwardly jazz album -- but my favourite moment is [the piano solo in "Love Me or Leave Me" (at 0:52)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uId47pfkAaE) which sounds more like Bach than jazz. \| I spent one sunny weekend this summer inside reading two novellas, and they'd both very high on a list of the greatest fiction I've ever read: **Chronicle of a Death Foretold** by Gabriel García Márquez and **The Outsider** (aka *The Stranger*) by Albert Camus \| **The films of Alfred Hitchcock**: The Birds and Rear Window are masterpieces; North by Northwest the best fun one; The Lady Vanishes is terrific and underrated; I haven't seen Psycho yet \| [Old **Slate Audio Booksclubs**](https://open.spotify.com/show/33vvuCy1GFLAcdD68E7IDP?si=58a091b7c57a4c77) -- by "old" I mean sort of 2006--2009, when Stephen Metcalf, Katie Roiphe, and Megan O'Rourke were common panellists; maybe start with [Philip Roth’s Everyman](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7tOEYmabxPpjt3zHXGbk7p?si=19f33dc4d3a54b34) \| Joan Didion’s essays [**"Slouching Towards Bethlehem"**](https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2017/06/didion/) and [**"On self-respect"**](https://www.vogue.com/article/joan-didion-self-respect-essay-1961).

SPORT: Stage 6 of the Vuelta a España -- Tony Martin went on a 175km solo breakway lasting four hours; I can only find [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZNgFiovZgk) of the last two minutes of it.

*Behind the blogpost*: OK, I admit that it's actually 2022 as I write, and I'm trying reconstruct this list from an old partially-completed draft I found on an ex-laptop. The last item on the list is "Marmots eating biscuits", with no hyperlink.I have no memory of what that was meant to refer to, but perhaps it was this:
