## Current teaching

### [MATH5835M Statistical Computing](../math5835/)

In 2025–26, Semester 1, (as in 2024–25) I am the module leader for **MATH5835M Statistical Computing**. [The main module webpage is here.](../math5835/)

### OMAT5203M Statistical Computing

I designed the module OMAT5203M Statistical Computing for the online programme [MSc Data Science (Statistics)](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/msc-data-science-ul), which runs on the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/msc-data-science-ul) platform. It ran for the first time in July–August 2025 (I was the module assistant) and will run every January–February and July–August.

### MATH5825M Independent Learning and Skills Project

In 2025–26, Semester 2, (as in 2023–24 and 2024–25) I am the module leader for MATH5825M Independent Learning and Skills Project (parts of which are cotaught with MATH5747M Learning Skills Through Case Studies). Material for this module is on Minerva.

### Other things

* MATH2900 Maths at Work: I used to advise a project on "Statistics in the media".
* MATH3001 Project in Mathematics: I advise a project on "Data compression".
* MATH5003M/5004M Assignment in Mathemics: I offer projects on "Arctan formulas" and "Recent progress on the union-closed sets conjecture". I have previously advised projects on the mathematics of gambling, and others.
* MATH5971M/MATH5872M Dissertation in Statisitcs / Data Science and Analytics: I offer projects on "Statistics, politics, law, and gerrymandering", "Pooled testing for Covid-19", and "MRP: Multilevel regression with post-stratification". I have previously advised projects on belief propogation, projects shared with industry, and others.

## Past teaching

### [MATH1710 Probability & Statistics I](../math1710/)

From 2021–22 to 2023–24, I lectured the module **[MATH1710 Probability and Statistics I](../math1710/)**. The main website for this module was [here](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math1710/). This material is similar, but not identical, to how the first half of the current MATH1700 Probability and Statistics is taught.

### [MATH2750 Introduction to Markov Processes](../math2750/)

From 2018-19 to 2020-21, I lectured the module **[MATH2750 Introduction to Markov Processes](../math2750/)**. The main website for this module was [here](https://mpaldridge.github.io/math2750/). This site very closely, but not quite perfectly, represents MATH2702 Stochastic Processes as it is currently taught.

### MATH3015 History of Mathematics

In 2019-20, I lectured one third of [MATH3015 History of Mathematics](./math3015/), on History of Statistics, with Dr Phil Walker and Dr Nicola Gambino. Some material is available [here](./math3015/). I'm not sure how closely this represents the module as it is currently taught.

### MA40042 Measure Theory and Integration (Bath)

In 2016-17 at the University of Bath, I lectured one half of [MA40042 Measure Theory and Integration](./ma40042/), on Measure Theory, with Dr Matt Roberts. Some material is available [here](./ma40042/). I don't know if or in what form this module still exists.

### MATH30002/MATHM0009 Topics in Discrete Mathematics (Bristol)

In 2013-14 at the University of Bristol, I lectured one third of of [MATH30002/MATHM0009 Topics in Discrete Mathematics](./math30002/), on Introduction to Graph Theory, with Dr Jonathan Bober and Dr Karen Gunderson. Some material is available [here](./math30002/). If this module still exists then it now covers entirely different topics.

## Other

### R Markdown

I have [some notes on using R Markdown and Bookdown](../rmarkdown-draft/). The intended audience is people (particularly people in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds) wanting to write accessible online lecture notes. It's somewhat out of date.
